# Inst-Weather-App

Inst-Weather is an web app that gets you instant weather details of any location once you enter the name of the location.

Ins-Weather was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript making use of the AccuWeather weather API. 

A free AccuWeather account was used to obtained the API key for the app. Thus, only 50 searches are allowed per day. After the 50th search or query, the app will not be able to fetch weather details anymore.
